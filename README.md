# Seinfeld Visualization Project

This project will utilize the dataset that was created and cleaned in a separate project.

## What Are The Makings of a Great Seinfeld Episode?

First we brainstormed a list of questions that we would like to investigate and hopefully answer with meaningful visualizations.
- Rating vs Character Lines --- Who speaks the most in highly rated episodes?
- Rating vs Writer / Director --- Who created the most well loved episodes?
- Character Lines vs Writer --- Did different writers tend to favor certain characters?
- Rating vs Release Date --- Did the show get better with time

The data presented some interesting findings, some expected and some entirely surprising. 
The final visualizations were gathered in a fun and interactive website. The atypical website design reflects the loose and goofy nature of the show.
